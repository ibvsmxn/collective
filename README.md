Collective Test

OPTION 1
How I usually do this to run this is by downloading & installing XAMPP and putting the 'collective' folder under htdocs.

OPTION 2
Although just running this folder as it is irrespective of its location should also work fine, as this isn't coded in PHP. Just ensure 'index.html' is opened in a browser and not an IDE.

The page is responsive across all screen sizes. The fact I got the API working in the first place is amazing - considering this is my first ever time doing this!

The page will look like this (on desktop)
