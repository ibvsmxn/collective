Collective Test

The safest way to run this is by downloading XAMPP and putting the 'collective' folder under htdocs
Make sure all 3 servers are running! 

Although just running this folder as it is should also work fine, as this isn't coded in PHP 

The page is responsive across all screen sizes, and I would've liked to do a LOT more, but the fact I got the API working in the first place is amazing - considering this is my first ever time doing this.
I reckon if I had more time, I would've attempted the bonus tasks as well.

You'll see in the JS code that I was trying to get an "active" state to be applied to the beers when they're selected
